Steepest Descents:
   Tolerance (Fmax)   =  1.00000e+01
   Number of steps    =          250

Energy minimization reached the maximum number of steps before the forces
reached the requested precision Fmax < 10.

writing lowest energy coordinates.

Back Off! I just backed up gromacs.gro to ./#gromacs.gro.1#

Steepest Descents did not converge to Fmax < 10 in 251 steps.
Potential Energy  = -4.6008613e+04
Maximum force     =  6.3750537e+03 on atom 18
Norm of force     =  1.5735212e+02
