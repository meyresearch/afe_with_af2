Reading file gromacs.tpr, VERSION 2022.3 (single precision)
Using 1 MPI thread
Using 16 OpenMP threads 


Steepest Descents:
   Tolerance (Fmax)   =  1.00000e+01
   Number of steps    =          250

step 11: One or more water molecules can not be settled.
Check for bad contacts and/or reduce the timestep if appropriate.
Wrote pdb files with previous and current coordinates

Energy minimization reached the maximum number of steps before the forces
reached the requested precision Fmax < 10.

writing lowest energy coordinates.

Back Off! I just backed up gromacs.gro to ./#gromacs.gro.1#

Steepest Descents did not converge to Fmax < 10 in 251 steps.
Potential Energy  = -8.3428669e+05
Maximum force     =  5.7762861e+03 on atom 4678
Norm of force     =  4.9869390e+01
